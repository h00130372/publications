# Introduction

## Submitting Your Publication

When you use OpenLab resources you agree to present/provide some public shareable information about your use case \(request\), resources you used, results of your work, and hopefully some feedback \(good or bad\) about the OpenLab experience and/or environment.

In order to get started you will want to do a couple of things.

* clone this document repository
* create a branch with your request ID \(issue number provided when you requested resources\)
